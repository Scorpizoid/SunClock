Release history (S80)
1.00
- the initial release

1.01
- the Moon visibility widget which shows the current percentage as well
- in the Menu you can now choose if you want to view the Arctic Circle, the Tropic of Cancer, the Equator, the Tropic of Capricorn and/ or the Antarctic Circle
- sunset and sunrise times corrected a bit so when the time is e.g. 8:01, it doesn't show as "8:1" any more
- menu hotkeys
- "Change region" dialog removed because it didn't quite work out - now the program centers the map to your current home city, defined in the Clock application
- changed the sidebar's font

- fixed a drawing-related bug which occurs in the January's map image


NOTE: After you've updated the S80 version, the program may give you a KERN-EXEC 3 error. To get rid of this error, delete the file C:\System\Data\sunclock.ini.
